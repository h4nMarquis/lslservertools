Software (Project) short description:

lslservertools is a LSL library (lsl native framework) who adds functionality
to LSL scripts in a "Software Engineering" friendly way.

Historically and structurally LSL is not a "Software Engineering" friendly
scripting language: if the scripter is not very aware of "Sofware Engineering"
"good" designs, codestyle and principles and he is not very spurred on by them,
the LSL scripts code becomes very quickly unmaintainable, leading to poor
software quality.

lslservertools, primarily, aims to improve LSL scripts maintainability,
reducing drastically redundant code.

At present there is no way to include an LSL script in another one, so it is
really impossibile to remove all redundancies and lslservertools has a bit
of uneliminable overhead. Told that, lslservertools use is able to highly
improve LSL scripts maintainability.

Branch Stable Information:

This is the stable branch and it is the branch of the already tested and
stable software.
The only development that is possible in this branch is related ONLY to
apply bugfixes.
The code in this branch (stable) will NOT change to add new functionality
or to refactoring the code.
This branch is for ONLY already DEEPLY and HEAVILY tested software and if
some of the software is here it is very likely it will NOT change often,
otherwise it means that software is in the wrong branch (that is:
it was merged in stable branch too soon from testing branch).
